## Summary
I build production-grade backend services and smart contract systems for crypto and web products. I focus on security, reliability, and a clean developer experience.

## What I do
- Design and ship smart contract systems (Solidity, OpenZeppelin).
- Build scalable REST APIs and background workers (Node.js, TypeScript, NestJS).
- Implement on-chain integrations (Ethers.js, Web3.js).
- Automate monitoring and operational workflows for contract systems.
- Deliver tested releases using modern tooling (Hardhat, Foundry).

## Impact
- Reduced serverless API latency by 70% and lowered infrastructure overhead by 50% through performance tuning and architecture updates.
- Sustained 99.5% uptime by improving integrations, observability, and failure handling.
- Increased automated test coverage to 95% and reduced production deployment failures by 40% by strengthening CI/CD workflows.
- Reduced post-release critical bugs by 15% by tightening release processes and monitoring.
- Delivered 50+ onboarding and KYB endpoints and maintained 17+ database revisions with consistent migrations and backward compatibility.
- Reduced quarterly cloud compute costs by 15% through resource optimization and deployment improvements.
- Cut client integration time by 50% by shipping SDKs with clear APIs and documentation.
